## Overview ##
This is a dynamic web application for a website refresh for KK Cabinets and Countertops. We used Firebase for file storage, and data storage. We also used Flask for connection to the server and to make the application dynamic.

# DEPENDENCIES #
This website is indirectly dependent on a git repo [here](https://github.com/Luke-zhang-04/user-recommendations)

## Background and Scope ##
The purpose of this project is to refresh the front page and revamp the Gallery section of the current website for KK Cabinets ([http://www.kkcabinets.ca](http://www.kkcabinets.ca)) to maximize customers' length of stay per visit.
## Basic Requirements: ##
1. Redesign the home page to enhance the first impressions of viewers by creating an artistic look and style on the main page
2. Redesign the gallery page to create navigation through the use of the product category. The product category can be designed to have multiple levels such as style, material, colour, etc.
## Optional Requirements (demo required): ##
1. Enable the functionality to display similar projects to the ones currently viewed by potential customers
2. Integrate the connections between the supply material/raw products/finished products allowing customers to search projects by various criteria<br/>
Students can use any programming languages such as PHP (cough cough)/Python (^_^)/MySQL for this project. Students can also use existing content management software such as WordPress. <br/><br/>
## Each team is suggested to have: ##
1. One <b>Scrum Master/Project Manager</b> to manage the deliverables
2. One <b>Business Analyst</b> to gather business requirements and facilitate implementation
3. One or two <b>Design Architect(s)</b> to design the from-end UI
4. One or two <b>Data Engineer(s)/Data Scientist(s)</b> to build back-end databases (optional) and/or predictive models

# KK Cabinets Background #
- K&amp;K Cabinets and Countertops is a custom made, one a time, product to enhance people’ homes by ergonomic means, aesthetics, and the way people cook, entertain and communicate in their kitchen space.
- We can transform peoples spaces with ergonomic cabinets, pot and pan drawers, and pull out spice cabinets. That way, people don’t have to get down on their hands and knees to look for things kept in a kitchen. Having things come out towards you, instead of bending down is a much better design. We create the very best possible designs for people with. This means that every kitchen we do, we design the cabinetry to be as accessible as possible. Pull out spice cabinet near the stove, pot and pan drawers, bank of drawers, pull out garbage, etc.
- deep units above the fridge so people can now use that cabinet.
- our designs have symmetry and balance to them, meaning we don’t put a big cabinet door near a small cabinet door; when a space is designed like this, it is very pleasing to the eye.
- we are trying to create the best space possible for our clients to cook, entertain and socialize in
- the kitchen is the new living room meaning it is out in the open so all can be part of what is going on.
## KK Cabinets is "Truly Custom" ##
- This means that each and every project we do, we are making and creating just for them. This is UNIQUE to us as one of our tag lines is that <b>we make custom affordable</b> as this is an advantage to the client. They are not paying any more to have any cabinets made that they would want, any size, width, colour.
- Many other kitchen companies - like IKEA, have premade sizes like 18”, 21”, 24”. It is a catalogue and you pick from what they have and put it in your space. This can leave big fillers on either side of the cabinets and doesn’t look great. You are limited to colours, and sizes.
## Our Process ##
- You get to meet with one of our designers and we work with you one on one to create your dream design. You tell us what you want and we will go to work to create it.
- The website should be created to get people to call us and have a one on one conversation to meet with one of our designers at our showroom. This way we can see if they are the right “fit” and start to gain and earn our trust as we review their space from measurements that they have brought it and look at door styles, construction methods, countertops, etc.
- One of the most amazing and unique things about K&amp;K Cabinets and Countertops is that we can control so much of the process for the client. The same technician always measures your space, then manufactures the cabinets and installs them. We create as much as we can in our local shop so that there is less cutting during the installation in your home.
- Usually what happens with other companies is that a person measures your space, then orders cabinets from far away. There are many many steps and different people involved in the project where many things and communication can break down and go wrong.
- With K&amp;K Cabinets, we create and manufacture our own doors and have our own spray booth so we can control so much of the process for the client; this way we can even have flexibility in our delivery dates.
- We are a Canadian company so therefore we you buy from K&amp;K you are supporting the Canadian economy and employing local people and supporting local business.
    - there are no hidden extra costs of duties and import fees.
    - There is local after sales service, we are here for you as we are a small local company that cares.
